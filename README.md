# Pomodoro 🍅

A Pomodoro Timer built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project began as part of the [Codedex Pomodoro Timer tutorial](https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-pomodoro-app-with-html-css-js), which provided the core functionality. I extended it by adding my own features and visual polish. The timer follows the Pomodoro Technique — 25 minutes of focused work followed by short breaks.

## ✨ Features

- Start, pause and reset timer
- Settings pannel with time configoration for break and session length
- Plus and minus buttons for incrementing timer by 5 minutes
- Sound alert when timer is up
- Light / dark theme toggle
- Modern design

## ⚙ Tech Stack

- CSS
